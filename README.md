Hello humans

My name is Milkybarkid1. I want to learn how to code and program. 
It seems impossible at this moment in time. But I will push myself to grasp an understanding of the concept and hopefully end up doing some cool things. 
I must perservere. Do not give up. This is your only life. Learn as much as you can.
